Opbasm change log
=================

v1.3 / 2015-12-??
=================

  Changes
  -------
  * Added notice that the default target will change to PB6 in 1.4 release
  * New command line simulator opbsim is included along with an automated test suite
  * New syntax: local labels starting with a "." and use of labels in
    address directives
  * New macros for handling scratchpad arrays: memcopy, memset, memwrite, hexwrite, bcdwrite
  * General purpose BCD conversion macros: ascii2bcd, int2bcd, and bcd2int
  * New generic string and packed string handler macros for both PB3 and PB6
  * High-level procedure and ISR macros with stack management of arguments and
    return values.
  * Added multilingual support with German and French translations
  * More efficient 16-bit shifts and rotates when the shift is greater than 8.
  * New, more compact delay_cycles() macro
  * Improved reporting of error line numbers when macros have been expanded in the original source.
    You will now see a mostly accurate indication of the original source line as well as the line
    numbers in the expanded source code. They are still off when errors occur inside nested macros
    and when C-style syntax is used with a line break before the "{".
  * Error messages now include the original source file. This works even when m4's include() macro is
    used instead of the PicoBlaze INCLUDE directive.
  * Removed the Pyparsing based parser. There are now no required external library dependencies.
  * Unreferenced constants, strings, and tables are reported in the log.
  * Added cstr() and estr() macros to generate numeric strings with C character escapes and an
    optional NUL terminator.
  * Added qstr() macro to wrap macros in double quotes.
  * ANSI escape code macros for color text
  * PRNG macros for 8 and 16-bit random numbers
  * Simple string hashing macro (Useful for building static PRNG seeds)
  * Added DATE_STAMP and TIME_STAMP macros for use within m4.
  * Add -D option to allow definition of m4 macros from the command line
  * Add automatic "keep" pragma to jump tables (2 or more consecutive unconditional jumps)
  * Support for KCPSM6 ECC template for 7-series devices
  * Support reading input source from stdin
  * Add support for Altera MIF output
  * Windows m4 binary is included
    
  Bug fixes
  ---------
  * Templates with multiple implementations containing larger memories than the memory map file would
    be generated with leftover {INIT...} fields. These are now filled in with assembled DEFAULT_JUMP
	instructions.
  * Spartan-3 XDL parsing in pb_update was not properly extracting the memory size parameters.
  * Nested for() loops had a bug that caused infinite looping.
  * Uppercase macros for shift and rotate operations were not working properly.
  * m4 complains about missing newline on the last line of a file. This has been eliminated.
  * Macro text inside quoted strings no longer expands.
  * Fixed leftover "const()" macros in commented out constant declarations.
  * Unicode text mode (cp65001) now works properly on Windows console. ANSI color does not work however.
  * Fix bug causing instructions allocated to the same address
  * Fix bugs in signed multiply and divide macros

v1.2 / 2014-12-12
=================

  Changes
  -------
  * Add static code analysis to identify dead code and optionally remove it
    ~ Suggested by Patrick Lehmann ~
  * New high-level macros: relational if(), for(), while(), dowhile(), named variables
  * C-style syntax for control flow macros: if(foo) { bar } else { baz }
  * PL360-style expressions including signed and unsigned mul/div among varying
    operand sizes
  * New cycle accurate delay macros
  * Add PRAGMA meta-comments with support for keeping dead code and arbitrary
    user-defined pragmas reported in the log file
  * Add UTF-8 support for comments
  * The pb_update script now supports memories split across multiple BRAMs
  * Picoblaze constants can be passed as arguments to most m4 macros

  Bug fixes
  -------
  * Fix error parsing include statements with relative paths and Windows-style paths
  * Fix bug with formatting label fields in colorized log
  * Fix bug with OUTPUTK instructions containing punctuation char constants


v1.1 / 2014-08-18
=================

  Changes
  -------
  * Add new regex based parser that is 6x faster than original pyparsing parser
  * New m4 preprocessor support and built-in macro package
  * Add support for undocumented STAR sX, kk instruction
  * New output directory command line option
  * Log file has phony addresses for non-instruction statements to match KCPSM behavior

  Bug fixes
  ---------
  * Fixed bug in writing latin1 HDL files
