v1.x / 2015-??-??
=================

  Changes
  -------
  * Added notice that the default target will change to PB6 in 1.4 release
  * Added multilingual support with German and French translations
  * More efficient 16-bit shifts and rotates when the shift is greater than 8.
  * Improved reporting of error line numbers when macros have been expanded in the original source.
    You will now see a mostly accurate indication of the original source line as well as the line numbers
	in the expanded source code. They are still off when errors occur inside nested macros and when C-style
	syntax is used with a line break before the "{".
  * Error messages now include the original source file. This works even when m4's include() macro is
    used instead of the PB INCLUDE directive.
  * Removed the Pyparsing based parser. There are now no required external library dependencies.
  * Unreferenced constants, strings, and tables are reported in the log.
  * Added cstr() and estr() macros to generate numeric strings with C character escapes and an optional NUL terminator.
  * Added qstr() macro to wrap macros in double quotes.
  * Added DATE_STAMP and TIME_STAMP macros for use within m4.
  * Add -D option to allow definition of m4 macros from the command line
  
  Bug fixes
  ---------
  * Templates with multiple implementations containing larger memories than the memory map file would
    be generated with leftover {INIT...} fields. These are now filled in with assembled DEFAULT_JUMP
	instructions.
  * Spartan-3 XDL parsing in pb_update was not properly extracting the memory size parameters.
  * Nested for() loops had a bug that caused infinite looping.
  * Uppercase macros for shift and rotate operations were not working properly.
  * m4 complains about missing newline on the last line of a file. This has been eliminated.
  * Macro text inside quoted strings no longer expands.
  * Fixed leftover "const()" macros in commented out constant declarations.
  * Unicode text mode (cp65001) now works properly on Windows console. ANSI color does not work however.

v1.2 / 2014-12-12
=================

  Changes
  -------
  * Add static code analysis to identify dead code and optionally remove it
    ~ Suggested by Patrick Lehmann ~
  * New high-level macros: relational if(), for(), while(), dowhile(), named variables
  * C-style syntax for control flow macros: if(foo) { bar } else { baz }
  * PL360-style expressions including signed and unsigned mul/div among varying
    operand sizes
  * New cycle accurate delay macros
  * Add PRAGMA meta-comments with support for keeping dead code and arbitrary
    user-defined pragmas reported in the log file
  * Add UTF-8 support for comments
  * The pb_update script now supports memories split across multiple BRAMs
  * Picoblaze constants can be passed as arguments to most m4 macros

  Bug fixes
  -------
  * Fix error parsing include statements with relative paths and Windows-style paths
  * Fix bug with formatting label fields in colorized log
  * Fix bug with OUTPUTK instructions containing punctuation char constants


v1.1 / 2014-08-18
=================

  Changes
  -------
  * Add new regex based parser that is 6x faster than original pyparsing parser
  * New m4 preprocessor support and built-in macro package
  * Add support for undocumented STAR sX, kk instruction
  * New output directory command line option
  * Log file has phony addresses for non-instruction statements to match KCPSM behavior

  Bug fixes
  ---------
  * Fixed bug in writing latin1 HDL files
